# Tensorflow-ML-using-Python
My **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** codes using Tensorflow, GPUs, TPUs and Python 3. Mostly these have been developed in Jupyter Notebook and Google's CoLab.
Here a very basic introduction to Tensorflow is given. [Link](https://github.com/AtharKharal/Tensorflow-ML-using-Python/blob/master/Tensorflow_Fundamentals.ipynb)
